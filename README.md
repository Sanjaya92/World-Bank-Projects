# World Bank Projects Overview (1947 - Present)

This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of World Bank-funded projects from 1947 to the most recent available year. It analyzes project funding trends, commitments, project costs, financial instruments, risk levels, and regional distribution.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes 

- All insights in this project are based on the committed amounts, as listed in the World Bank data.

  These do not reflect actual disbursements ‚Äî meaning the committed money may not have been fully spent or delivered due to changes, delays, or project cancellations.



- The dashboard was designed to be interactive in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjaya.kunwar/vizzes), but due to GitHub limitations, you can only explore it by:

  Downloading the .twbx file and opening in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public

  Browsing through the provided screenshots

## üéØ Goals of the Analysis

Before starting the analysis, the following questions were asked:
- How has World Bank investment changed over the years?
- Which countries and regions have received the most funding?
- What types of lending instruments were used?
- How much of the project cost is covered by commitments?
- Are there any patterns in risk levels and project status?

## üßπ Data Cleaning Process

- Data was sourced directly from the **[World Bank Open Projects Dataset](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/projects-list)**.
- Timeline: Covers **projects from 1947 to present**.
- **Inconsistencies were found** between project documents and spreadsheet amounts.
  - In such cases, **the most reliable source value was kept**.
- **Monetary formatting varied**:
  - Some amounts were in small values (e.g., 0.05, 1, 10)
  - Some were in **millions** (e.g., 100, 500, 1000+)
  - All values were **converted into consistent whole numbers** for better aggregation and visualization.

## üìê Calculated Fields

### 1. **Adjusted Commitment**
To handle gaps where the project cost was 0, the following field was created:
```tableau
IF [Current Project Cost] > 0 THEN [Total IBRD, IDA and Grant Commitment] ELSE 0 END
```

### 2. **Commitment Percentage on Project Cost**
To calculate how much of a country or group‚Äôs project cost is covered by commitment:
```tableau
IF SUM([Current Project Cost]) = 0 THEN
    NULL
ELSE
    SUM([Adjusted Total Commitment]) / SUM([Current Project Cost])
END
```
This calculation adjusts based on the dimension being used (e.g., Country, Lending Instrument, Region).
